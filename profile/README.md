Welcome to the Github Organisation of TeamnTime. We are a team of developers that creates software for hospitals and care organisation in order to better plan and schedule their nursing staff, based on objective KPIs.

Our aim is to improve the lives of nursing staff whilst ensuring that the patient gets the care they need.

We are actively looking for C# developers with a statistical background and PHP/Symfony developers with a strong DevOps background. If this sounds like you, do feel free to reach out via [join@teamntime.com](mailto:join@teamntime.com)
